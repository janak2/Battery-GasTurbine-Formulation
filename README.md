# Battery-GasTurbine-Formulation

In this repository we have modeled and optimized the dynamics of hybrid systems with gas turbines and
energy storage devices for better decision making.   
Implemented a mixed linear programming model in Python formulated using
packages like Pyomo and Numpy and advanced optimization tools like Gurobi
solver.
